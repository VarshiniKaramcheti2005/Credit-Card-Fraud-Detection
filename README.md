# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Introduction:
Credit card fraud has become a significant concern with the rise of online transactions. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real time is challenging due to the vast volume of data and the sophisticated techniques used by fraudsters. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

Problem Statement:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine based on past transaction patterns. The challenge lies in handling imbalanced datasets, ensuring high accuracy while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frameworks: Flask (for deployment), Jupyter Notebook (for development)

Expected Outcome:
A machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.
Insights into key features and transaction behaviors indicative of fraud.
A comparison of different ML algorithms for fraud detection.

Conclusion:
This project aims to enhance financial security by leveraging machine learning for fraud detection. The findings can help banks and financial institutions minimize financial losses and improve fraud prevention systems.
